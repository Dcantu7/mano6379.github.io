           The daughter of an educator and a Hawaiian fisherman, Malia Ka’aihue believes that once you understand your foundation, and you know who you are, then you can achieve anything. In fact, she says, her foundation has been her most important asset in life. The knowledge of her family history, coupled with the belief that one continues to carry on the story of their ancestors, has given her a strong sense of identity that propels Malia to explore new ventures and recreate herself along the way. Currently, as a partner at DTL(meaning “detail”), a Hawaiian Strategy Studio, which she founded in 2013, Malia works with organizations and businesses to recognize their assets and goals while keeping Hawaiian sensibilities and sensitivities at the forefront.

He is quick to say that being born Hawaiian ensured he was instilled with these qualifications, but anyone who practices pono is able to learn and practice these things.
